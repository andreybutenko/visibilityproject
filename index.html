          <h2 class="text-center">Why?</h2>
          <p class="text-center">Homelessness is a pervasive issue in Seattle, with over 5,500 individuals afflicted with it. While the city is working to create additional housing and to refine its overall approach, it is important to support those individuals now.</p>
          <p class="text-center">A conversation is an easy way to reach out, show support, and develop your empathy. A conversation is low-commitment, but is an opportunity to be compassionate and can have a big impact on those you engage with. A conversation is a chance to learn about another person's life and develop a relationship.</p>

          <div class="icon-container"><i class="fas fa-child"></i></div>
          <h2 class="text-center">What can I do?</h2>
          <p class="text-center">It's simple: just approach and have a chat! In a walk downtown, you likely walk pass dozens of homeless individuals who are too often ignored. You don't have to ignore them: reaching out and having a conversation may be the most interesting, most rewarding thing you do that day.</p>
          <p class="text-center">If you're feeling unsure of yourself, we have a whole page with <a href="/pages/approach/">information on how to have a conversation.</a> It's easier than you think!</p>

          <h1 class="display-4 text-center">This is Jolene.</h1>
          <p>I met Jolene while she was asking for money at a street-corner in front of Target.</p>
          <p>Speaking with her, her selflessness became clear: despite not having housing and struggling to take care of herself, she always puts the needs of her cat Shadow first.</p>
          <p>Currently, she's living in a tent in some nearby woods. It is not a safe spot for her, and the racoons are a danger to Shadow.</p>
          <p>There are only a few shelters in Seattle that accept pets, but after being on the waitlist for months, she's getting ready to move in! Although the shelter provides free pet food, residents are required to have a certain set of items prepared beforehand, including a litter box. That is what Jolene was asking for on the street corner: money for a litter box for her cat Shadow.</p>
          <p>Jolene is just one of the many remarkable people you can encounter when you are willing to reach out and have even a short conversation.</p>
